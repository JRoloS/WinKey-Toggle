Windows Key Disabler is a Python application built with Qt that allows users to easily disable or enable the Windows key through a simple button press or a designated hotkey (WIN + Backspace). This tool is designed for users who need to temporarily disable the Windows key to prevent accidental interruptions during their work or gaming sessions.
